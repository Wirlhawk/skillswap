                            SkillSwap was born from a simple observation:
                            students have incredible talents that often go
                            unrecognized and underutilized. Whether it's graphic
                            design, tutoring, coding, or creative writing, every
                            student brings unique skills to the table.

                            We created this platform to bridge the gap between
                            talented students and those who need their services,
                            fostering a community where learning and earning go
                            hand in hand.
